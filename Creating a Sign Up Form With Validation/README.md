The following is a form validation demo using the frameworks Bootstrap and AngularJS. The languages used were HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The "Standard Validation" folder contains a functioning sign-up form, but a lot of the code is repeated so I decided to examine the AngularJS docs to figure out if there was a way to auto-validate the form without having to type so many lines of copy-pasted code.
